              >A lot of shiny new features came out with ES2015 (ES6). And now,
              since it's 2020, it's assumed that a lot of JavaScript developers
              have become familiar with and have started using these
              features.</span

            <p>
              While this assumption might be partially true, it's still possible
              that some of these features remain a mystery to some devs. One of
              the features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and const,
              which can be used for variable declaration. The question is, what
              makes them different from good ol' var which we've been using? If
              you are still not clear about this, then this article is for you.
              In this article, we'll discuss var, let and const with respect to
              their scope, use, and hoisting. As you read, take note of the
              differences between them that I'll point out.

              <p>
                There's a weakness that comes with var. I'll use the example
                below to explain:

                So, since times > 3 returns true, greeter is redefined to "say
                Hello instead". While this is not a problem if you knowingly
                want greeter to be redefined, it becomes a problem when you do
                not realize that a variable greeter has already been defined
                before. If you have used greeter in other parts of your code,
                you might be surprised at the output you might get. This will
                likely cause a lot of bugs in your code. This is why let and
                const are necessary.

              <p class="text-base font-bold">
                let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise
                as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also
                solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider
                why this is so.
              </p>
              <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5">let is block scoped</h2>
              <p class="mb-5">
                A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly
                braces. Anything within curly braces is a block. So a variable
                declared in a block with let is only available for use within
                that block. Let me explain this with an example:
              </p>
              <img src="./img/Screenshot_2.png" alt="" />

              <p class="text-base font-bold">
                Variables declared with the const maintain constant values.
                const declarations share some similarities with let
                declarations.

              </h2>
              <p class="mb-5">
                This means that the value of a variable declared with const
                remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or
                re-declared. So if we declare a variable with const, we can
                neither do this:

              Introduction to undefined and null values
            </h2>
            <p>
              Many times we often get confused on what the difference between
              UNDEFINED and NULL is. Simply put, undefined means a variable has
              been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. undefined is
              a type by itself (undefined). Unassigned variables are initialized
              by JavaScript with a default value of undefined.

              Undefined vs null - the differences
            </h2>
            <p>
              The data type of undefined is undefined whereas that of null is
              object. We can find the datatypes of both undefined and null using
              the typeof operator.
            </p>
            <img src="./img/Screenshot_5.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              When used in arithmetic operations, undefined will result in NaN
              (not a number), whereas null will be converted to 0 behind the
              screens.

            <p>
              Here the boolean double negation operator aka the bang bang
              operator is used to check the boolean equivalent of a value.

            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Why is Null an object?</h2>
            <p>
              As promised, now let’s look as to why the type of null is an
              “object”. As it then indicates that null must be an object, which
              is not true. In fact, null is one of the primitive values in
              JavaScript. It is actually a bug in the language and unfortunately
              can’t be fixed that easily, as it will break the existing
              codebase. However, there is actually one logical explanation
              behind why null is an object in javascript. In the initial version
              of JavaScript, values were stored in 32 bit units. The first 3
              bits represented the data type tag followed by the remaining bits
              that represented the value. For all objects it was 000 as the type
              tag bits. null was considered to be a special value in JavaScript
              from its very first version. null was a representation of the null
              pointer. However, there were no pointers in JavaScript like C. So
              null simply meant nothing or void and was represented by all 0’s.
              Hence all its 32 bits were 0’s. So whenever the JavaScrit
              interpreter reads null, it considers the first 3 bits as type
              “object”. That is why typeof null returns “object”.

              Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style
              that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web
              services. REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple
              and flexible way without having any processing.

            <img src="./img/Screenshot_8.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              REST technology is generally preferred to the more robust Simple
              Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST uses less
              bandwidth, simple and flexible making it more suitable for
              internet usage. It’s used to fetch or give some information from a
              web service. All communication done via REST API uses only HTTP
              request. Working: A request is sent from client to server in the
              form of a web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or DELETE request.
              After that, a response comes back from the server in the form of a
              resource which can be anything like HTML, XML, Image, or JSON. But
              now JSON is the most popular format being used in Web Services.

            <p>
              In HTTP there are five methods that are commonly used in a
              REST-based Architecture i.e., POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
              These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD)
              operations respectively. There are other methods which are less
              frequently used like OPTIONS and HEAD.<br />

              <strong> GET:</strong> The HTTP GET method is used to read (or
              retrieve) a representation of a resource. In the safe path, GET
              returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code
              of 200 (OK). In an error case, it most often returns a 404 (NOT
              FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST).<br />
              <strong> POST:</strong> The POST verb is most often utilized to
              create new resources. In particular, it’s used to create
              subordinate resources. That is, subordinate to some other (e.g.
              parent) resource. On successful creation, return HTTP status 201,
              returning a Location header with a link to the newly-created
              resource with the 201 HTTP status.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong> PUT:</strong> It is used for updating the capabilities.
              However, PUT can also be used to create a resource in the case
              where the resource ID is chosen by the client instead of by the
              server. In other words, if the PUT is to a URI that contains the
              value of a non-existent resource ID. On successful update, return
              200 (or 204 if not returning any content in the body) from a PUT.
              If using PUT for create, return HTTP status 201 on successful
              creation. PUT is not safe operation but it’s idempotent.<br />
              <strong> PATCH:</strong> It is used to modify capabilities. The
              PATCH request only needs to contain the changes to the resource,
              not the complete resource. This resembles PUT, but the body
              contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently
              residing on the server should be modified to produce a new
              version. This means that the PATCH body should not just be a
              modified part of the resource, but in some kind of patch language
              like JSON Patch or XML Patch. PATCH is neither safe nor
              idempotent.<br />
              <strong> DELETE: </strong>It is used to delete a resource
              identified by a URI. On successful deletion, return HTTP status
              200 (OK) along with a response body.
